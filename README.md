The Goal
-
 We aim to create a game immersive and captivating enough
to distract a kid from pain and reduce anxiety or fear during medical procedures.
The Philosophy
-
The game’s philosophy is simple – the more beautiful the world around the player is, the easier
it is to force the player to forget about their real-world troubles. At the same time, the gameplay
mechanics should be kept straightforward and plain, so a potentially mechanically-restricted kid could
grasp them.
Used Technologies
-
We chose to create the game in VR to make it more accessible and improve its learning curve.
The controls are as natural as they can get – the player only has to move their head to fully enjoy the
experience.
The Game
-
The core gameplay mechanics go as follows: the player is a captain of a flying ship which makes
its way through a never-ending beautiful sea of soft fluffy clouds. The ship’s “crew” consists of a cute
dragon  companion which helps to navigate the ship by moving to respective floor buttons responsible for
the movement change. The player guides the creature by looking directly at its desirable destination.
The companion, the world and the journey itself are the three pillars our pain distraction strategy
stands on.

### 1) The companion.

The companion’s behavior is designed to invoke joy and care with its responsive animations and
a lively reaction to the player’s interactions.

### 2) The world

The world’s enchanting and peaceful, yet captivating and rapidly changing: the all-consuming
vibrant bright colors, together with an avalanche of puffy clouds of all sorts and shapes form a perfect
surrounding to embrace, leaving all the real-life problems behind.

### 3) The journey 

The goal of the player's mission is to swim to the castle, simultaneously helping the inhabitants of the island and overcoming obstacles. By focusing on the case the player will be more distracted from the pain

The brain must process all these emotions. Our plan is to load him with work so that he doesn't have enough resources to feel pain.
